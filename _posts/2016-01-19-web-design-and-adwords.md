I'll explain the basics of Adwords first as a precursor to explaining that the part of your website that you send traffic to through Adwords - called a "landing page" - largely determines how much Adwords costs to run, and whether or not you're able to turn a profit with it.

At 31, Josh Johnson has been an independent Adwords consultant for over a decade. In that time, he's worked with Fortune 500 companies, and helped to sell products you can see on television nightly.
With his partner, Brody Nickol, he's known as half of the PayPerClickWeirdos(.com), largely because their marketing abilities makes it easy for clients to overlook their hobbies, which include knife catching on a professional level, and jumping off of tall things for fun.
