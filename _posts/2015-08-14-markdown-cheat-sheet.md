While Markdown is a brilliantly simple language to learn, those new to Markdown often find that they forget the specific syntax _(or is that just me?)_.

Here are a few of my favorite Markdown resources:

- [Markdown Basics](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)
- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
- [John Gruber's Original Markdown Project Page](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
- [Writing in Markdown, by Matt Gemmell](http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/writing-in-markdown)
