Join us on August 18 as we take a look at how to build a simple blog using Jekyll. 

We will learn how to install and run Jekyll using the command line _(yikes!)_, how to create Jekyll templates and how to use Markdown to create our blog entries.

Jekyll is a blog-aware, static site generator powered by Ruby. Jekyll takes a series of text files and templates, runs them through a converter and creates static HTML files that you can then upload to a server or host on Github.
