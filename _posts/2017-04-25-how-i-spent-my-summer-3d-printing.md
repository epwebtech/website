We’ll discuss the latest technology sweeping the globe, 3D printing. The talk will briefly touch on the history of 3D printing and then get right into the questions on everyone’s mind: What types are printers are there? What can you make with them? How much do 3D printers cost? How do they work? There will be a demonstration of two different 3D printers and a collection of 3D printed objects.
