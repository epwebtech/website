A brief run-down of common mistakes Adwords advertisers make, and how you can avoid them, delivered by an industry veteran who's spent millions of dollars in hundreds of campaigns. 

Josh Johnson, 32, has been creating and promoting websites for almost 20 years. He started a consulting firm in the year 2000, took a partner sometime in the mid-oughts, and is now lives the kind of life where he can be a respected expert in his field, despite only having to wear "real pants" twice in 2016. His hobbies still include catching knives on a professional level, and jumping off of tall things.
